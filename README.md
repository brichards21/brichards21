### Hi there and Howdy! 👋

My name is Breanna! 
- I'm a Data Scientist with 3+ years of internship and part-time experience leveraging data-driven insights to drive business success and user satisfaction!
- I've worked/collaborated with teams at Google, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School/Massachusetts General Hospital, Brown University, and Amherst College
- I have a Master's degree from Brown University (Biostatistics) and a Bachelor's degree from Amherst College (Statistics)!

### Some of my Key Accomplishments and Favorite Experiences!

✨ Successfully led and advocated for the utility of a brand-new anti-spam feature for Android devices using data-driven insights, A/B testing, and strategic and effective communication with diverse senior leadership.

✨ Improved the predictive accuracy of an established microsimulation model against empirical estimates by a root-mean-squared error of ~3% to more accurately inform a tax policy analysis study on tobacco use.

✨ Optimized the random forest machine learning algorithm with a 5% improvement in classifying between major rarely distinguishable subtypes of cancer, prioritizing relevant early treatment assignments, and thus improving long-term patient prognosis.

✨ Curated and analyzed qualitative and quantitative data on success and learning outcomes for underrepresented students in STEM to drive curriculum development and provide actionable insights to leaders in STEM education for 10+ universities.


### Favorite Projects!
I've hosted a variety of data science/statistics/data analyst projects on GitHub. Here are a few of my favorites:

- [Detecting Spam in the Presence of Spoofing on SMS Platforms](https://brichards21.github.io/SMSDiscordSpam/): Leveraged personal Discord messaging data to define potential detection methods when a spammer poses as a trusted source (spoofing) using natural language processing (NLP) in Python (pandas, NumPy, NLTK) and visualization libraries in R (ggplot2).
