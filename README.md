### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Breanna! 
- I'm a Data Scientist with 3+ years of internship and part-time experience leveraging data-driven insights to drive business success and user satisfaction!
- I've worked/collaborated with teams at Google, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School/Massachusetts General Hospital, Brown University, and Amherst College
- I have a Master's degree from Brown University (Biostatistics) and a Bachelor's degree from Amherst College (Statistics)!

I've hosted a variety of data science/statistics/data analyst projects on GitHub. Here are a few of my favorites:

- [Detecting Spam in the Presence of Spoofing on SMS Platforms](https://brichards21.github.io/SMSDiscordSpam/): Leveraged personal Discord messaging data to define potential detection methods when a spammer poses as a trusted source (spoofing) using natural language processing (NLP) in Python (pandas, NumPy, NLTK) and visualization libraries in R (ggplot2).
